The system assumes that only registered clients can submit service requests, and each request must belong to exactly one client. A client may register without ever submitting a request, and a request may include zero to five uploaded photos, therefore photos are optional and limited by system rules rather than cardinality notation.

Quotes are modeled separate because multiple quotes may be proposed for a single request and every quote response or counter message must be stored as evidence in case of disputes. An order is created only when a quote is accepted, so most quotes do not lead to orders, but every order must come from exactly one accepted quote. Bills are generated only for completed orders and there is never more than one bill for a single order, since billing changes or disputes are recorded as messages rather than as new bills. Payments are stored independently because a bill can involve multiple payment attempts or partial payments. Anna Johnson is not modeled as a user entity, it is assumed that admin actions are performed through authorized access by Anna alone.
